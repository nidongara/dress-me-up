# Dressing Problem

You are in your house wearing pajamas. You must be appropriately dressed for the temperature before leaving your house.
Your challenge is to programmatically process a list of commands for getting ready, enforce related rules, and display appropriate output

## Installation

Requires Maven to build the project. 
- Run "mvn install" at the root of the project to build the jar.
- Run "mvn test" at the root to run the unit tests

## Usage

After the executable jar is ready run the following command inside the target folder
 - java -jar coding-exercise-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
 
or from root
 
 - java -jar target/coding-exercise-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
